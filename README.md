# The Algorithm
- A circle has points evenly placed around its circumference and assigned a number ranging from 0 up to the number of divisions.
- For each point, it's index is multiplied by a multiplier.
- A line is drawn from the current index to the index of the result.
- This algorithm creates patterns that become more distinct as the number of divisions increase.
